Testng.xml File Usage:
In a Selenium TestNG project, we use testng.xml file to configure the complete test suite in a single file. 
testng.xml file allows to include or exclude the execution of test methods and test groups
It allows to pass parameters to the test cases
Allows to add group dependencies
Allows to add priorities to the test cases
Allows to configure parallel execution of test cases
Allows to parameterize the test cases


Overloaded Methosd of TestNg:
assertEqual(String actual,String expected)
assertEqual(String actual,String expected, String message)
assertTrue(condition)
assertTrue(condition, message)
assertFalse(condition)
assertFalse(condition, message)


Asserts are used to perform validations in the test scripts.

There are two types of Assert:

Hard Assert
Soft Assert


Hard Assert – Hard Assert throws an AssertException immediately when an assert statement fails and test suite continues with next @Test

The disadvantage of Hard Assert – It marks method as fail if assert condition gets failed and the remaining statements inside the method will be aborted.
To overcome this we need to use Soft Assert. Let’s see what is Soft Assert.

Soft Assert – Soft Assert collects errors during @Test. Soft Assert does not throw an exception when an assert fails and would continue with the next step after the assert statement.

If there is any exception and you want to throw it then you need to use assertAll() method as a last statement in the @Test and test suite again continue with next @Test as it is.

We need to create an object to use Soft Assert which is not needed in Hard Assert.
